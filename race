#
#Task: To create a simple game where the player controls a turtle that can move left and right while trying to collect falling items.

#####Setup#####
#Use this section to organize global data

#Import Libraries
import turtle as t
import time
import random as r
#Global Variable
jeff = t.Turtle()
jeb = t.Turtle()
bob = t.Turtle()

t1 = t.Turtle()
t2 = t.Turtle()
t3 = t.Turtle()
t4 = t.Turtle()
screen = t.Screen()

#Lists
foods = [t1,t2,t3,t4]
score = []
#####Functions#####

##Core Game Functions##

#Create Score
#Create the score field on the top of the screen

    jeb.penup()
    jeb.ht()
    jeb.goto(-210,-10)
    jeb.write("score : ")
    jeb.goto(-200,-25)
    jeb.write(0)

#Create Player
#Create and draw player onto the screen in starting position
def create_player():
    jeff.color("orange")
    jeff.penup()
#Move Player Left
#Move player left in response to arrow key
def left():

    move_collectable()

#Move Player Right
#Move player right in response to arrow key
def right():
    jeff.forward(7)
    check_horizontal_bounds()

#Check Player Screen Bounds (Horizontal)
#Check to see if the player is within the vertical bounds, if not set the player to the bound

#Create Collectable
#Use a for loop to create and store your collectables into a list

#Go through your list of collectables and move each item

        food.forward(dist)
        check_vertical_bounds()
        check_collectable()

#Check Collectable Screen Bounds (Vertical)
#Check to see if a falling item is below vertical bounds, if so move back to the top
#Must pass the item in as an arguement
def check_vertical_bounds():
    for food in foods:

            food.goto(rand_x,rand_y)
            food.showturtle()
        

#Check Player Catch Collectable
#Pass in a collectable item from a list and determine if it is in contact/proximity with the player
#Must pass the item in as an arguement
def check_collectable():
    for food in foods:
        if int(food.distance(jeff))<=5:
            update_score()

            food.goto(rand_x,rand_y)

#Update Score
#If contact between collectable and player is made, update global score
def update_score():
    score.append(1)
    jeb.dot(30, "white")
    jeb.write(sum(score))

##Extendable Functions##

#Intro Screen
def start_screen():
    pass

#Life Tracker
def update_lives():
    pass

#Game Over Screen
def game_over():
    pass


#####Setup Function Calls#####
#Use this section to call any core functions that are only called once and help to setup the turtle/game environment
create_player()
screen.onkey(left , "a")
screen.onkey(right , 'd')
create_collectables()
setup_score()
screen.listen()

#####Core Game Loop#####
#Use this while loop to create your game loop, define logic and call above functions
for x in range(100):
   check_horizontal_bounds()
